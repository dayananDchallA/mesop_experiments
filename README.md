I came across this latest open-source Python framework named ‘Mesop,’ which is used by teams at Google for internal tooling and rapid prototyping.

#### Features of Mesop
- Open-Source.
- Easy to get started with pre-built components.
- Code in idiomatic Python.
- Hot-reload.
- Components are basically Python Functions.
- Built on Angular.

#### Getting Started with Mesop
There are mainly three components you must be aware of while building with Mesop:

- State Class: This will act as your session’s state and provides the ability to share data among different components.
- Pages and Events: The main UI of the app.
- Styling Elements: CSS styles (Tailwind support is yet to come)

Before starting out make sure to install mesop using pip install mesop.

For more information on how to build apps refer:

**Note**: Mesop is still in its nascent stage, so don’t start using to build complex UI with it. Also, it is not officially supported by Google.
